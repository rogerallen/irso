An Album of Irrational Songs in Overtone
by Roger Allen

I am going to explore using irrational numbers as a basis for musical
melodies.  I want to use only Overtone to create the audio, so the
source code will be the score.  I like ambient soundscape music and
I'd like to create an album of songs here.  The plan is basically:
arrange the songs, add effects, do post-production, then release.

We'll see where this goes.

## Usage

At some point lein run will create live music or mp3 audio that you
can take with you.  Right now, if you are interested you should browse
the source and play at the repl.

## Building LOCALSNAPSHOT overtone

0.6.0 has issues with sampled-piano, so I use a local 0.7.0 build.

cd ...local path to your.../overtone
edit project.clj to have version ending in "LOCALSNAPSHOT"
lein clean
lein deps
lein install
  ...
  Created .../overtone/overtone/overtone-0.7.0-LOCALSNAPSHOT.jar

cd .../explore_overtone/
lein clean

mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=../../overtone/overtone-0.7.0-LOCALSNAPSHOT.jar \
  -DartifactId=overtone \
  -Dversion=0.7.0-LOCALSNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=overtone \
  -Dpackaging=jar \
  -DlocalRepositoryPath=maven_repository

lein deps
lein repl
