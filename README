An Album of Irrational Songs in Overtone
by Roger Allen

I am going to explore using irrational numbers as a basis for musical
melodies.  I want to use only Overtone to create the audio, so the
source code will be the score.  I like ambient soundscape music and
I'd like to create an album of songs.  The plan is basically:
arrange the songs, add effects, do post-production, then release.

We'll see where this goes.

## Usage

To play a song, use lein run :<song> to listen to the song.  This will
also display a window with an overview of the song's sequences.

To record a song, use lein run :rec-<song>

<song> is one of eso, phiso, piso, sqrt2so, sqrt3so or tauso

Still, if you are interested you should browse the source and play at
the repl.

*NOTE* on the first "lein run" you will likely get an error.  Just
Ctrl-C, retry and it should work after that.  See
