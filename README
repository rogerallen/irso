An Album of Irrational Songs in Overtone
by Roger Allen

I am going to explore using irrational numbers as a basis for musical
melodies.  I want to use only Overtone to create the audio, so the
source code will be the score.  I like ambient soundscape music and
I'd like to create an album of songs.  The plan is basically:
arrange the songs, add effects, do post-production, then release.

We'll see where this goes.

## Usage

To play a song, use lein run :<song> to listen to the song.  This will
also display a window with an overview of the song's sequences.

To record a song, use lein run :rec-<song>

<song> is one of eso, piso, sqrt2so, sqrt3so or tauso

Still, if you are interested you should browse the source and play at
the repl.

## Building LOCALSNAPSHOT overtone

0.6.0 has issues with sampled-piano, so I use a local 0.7.0 build.

cd ...local path to your.../overtone
edit project.clj to have version ending in "LOCALSNAPSHOT"
lein clean
lein deps
lein install
  ...
  Created .../overtone/overtone/overtone-0.7.0-LOCALSNAPSHOT.jar

cd .../explore_overtone/
lein clean

mvn install:install-file \
  -Dfile=../../overtone/overtone-0.7.0-LOCALSNAPSHOT.jar \
  -DartifactId=overtone \
  -Dversion=0.7.0-LOCALSNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=overtone \
  -Dpackaging=jar \
  -DlocalRepositoryPath=maven_repository

lein deps
lein repl
